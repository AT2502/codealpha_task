•	Iris Flower Classification

•	Overview

•	Objective : Build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species based on their measurements.

•	Dataset: Classic Iris dataset with 150 samples, 4 features, 3 species
o	Features: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
o	Species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

•	Task Requirements

•	 Use measurements of Iris flowers as input +data
•	 Train a machine learning model to classify species
•	 Use Scikit-learn for dataset access and model building
•	 Evaluate model accuracy and performance
•	 Understand basic classification concepts

•	Implementation

•	Phase 1: Environment Setup
o	Imported all necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
o	Set up visualization parameters and styling

•	Phase 2: Data Loading & Exploration
o	Loaded iris dataset from scikit-learn
o	Explored dataset structure and statistics
o	Verified data quality (no missing values)

•	Phase 3: Data Visualization
o	Created pair plots for feature relationships
o	Generated box plots for species comparison
o	Built a correlation heatmap
o	Analyzed feature distributions

•	Phase 4: Data Preprocessing
o	Split data into features (X) and target (y)
o	Applied train-test split (80/20) with stratification
o	Implemented feature scaling for algorithms that need it

•	Phase 5: Model Training & Selection
•	Trained and compared 4 different algorithms:
•	Logistic Regression
•	Decision Tree
•	Random Forest
•	Support Vector Machine

•	Phase 6: Model Evaluation
o	Generated classification reports
o	Created confusion matrices
o	Analyzed feature importance
o	Calculated precision, recall, and F1-scores

•	Phase 7: Model Testing & Validation
o	Tested with new flower measurements
o	Implemented cross-validation
o	Created prediction function for production use
•	Phase 8: Documentation & Reporting
o	Comprehensive project documentation
o	Key insights and recommendations
o	Ready-to-use prediction system

•	Results

•	Best Model Performance
o	Best Model: Random Forest / SVM (tie)
o	Test Accuracy: 96.7%
o	Cross-validation: 95%+ consistent performance

•	Key Insights
o	Setosa is easily distinguishable from other species
o	Petal measurements are most discriminative features
o	Tree-based models excel on this dataset
o	All models achieved excellent performance (>90% accuracy)
